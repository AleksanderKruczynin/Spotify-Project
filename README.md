# Spotify-Project
I got inspired by Spotify App, and tried to recreate it from scratch.
On a website is a list of songs that are saved in the external folder as a mp3 files. In future i would like to use a database to save the songs there, or learn how to use the API-key from spotify.
Here are some features that i made with JavaScript:
1. If u click on the song u like, the music will start playing and the footer will change it look.
2. U can change to volume of the song with the volume control and lengh of the song with the song progress bar.
3. U can use the Play/Pause button to stop the song or start it again.
4. U can also use the Mute button near the volume control, it will mute the song, or unmute it.
