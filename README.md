# Spotify-Project
I got inspired by the Spotify app and tried to recreate it from scratch. On a website is a list of songs that are saved in the external folder as MP3 files. In the future, I would like to use a database to save the songs there or learn how to use the API key from Spotify.

Here are some features that I made with JavaScript:

1. Song selection:     If you click on the song you like, the music will start playing and the footer will change its look.
2. Song settings:      You can use the song progress bar and volume bar to control the song and sound.
3. Play/Pause button:  You can use the Play/Pause button to stop the song or start it again.
4. Mute button:        You can also use the Mute button near the volume control; it will mute the song or unmute it.
